# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

**Overview:**  
 The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions accurately. Using a Kaggle dataset, we trained a Logistic Regression model, handled class imbalance using SMOTE, and evaluated the model with precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Additionally, a user-friendly Streamlit application was created to allow users to input transaction details and predict fraud probability.
